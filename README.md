# Android OAuth Starter Code

This starter code shows how to make an OAuth call ([implicit method](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/introduction/authentication.html#implicit-method)) to get a [user token](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/introduction/authentication.html#user-token) from ARTIK Cloud.

## Demo

- Run the Android app. Sign in or sign up on the following screen:

## Prerequisites
* Android Studio

## Setup / Installation:

### Set up at ARTIK Cloud

Follow [these instructions](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/tutorials/your-first-application.html#create-an-application) to create an application using the Developer Dashboard. For this tutorial, select the following:

- Set "Redirect URL" for your application to `http://example.com/redirect_url`.
- Choose "Client Credentials, auth code, implicit".

[Make a note of your client ID.](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/tools/web-tools.html#how-to-find-your-application-id) This is your application ID, which you will need in the next step.

### Set up your Android project

- Change `CLIENT_ID` to your client ID (application ID) at the following line in `MainActivity.java`:

~~~java
private static final String CLIENT_ID = "<YOUR CLIENT ID>";
~~~

- Make sure `REDIRECT_URI` at the following line in `MainActivity.java` is consistent with "Redirect URL" for your application at the Developer Dashboard:

~~~java
public static final String REDIRECT_URI = "http://example.com/redirect_url";
~~~

- Make sure the intent filter fields at the following lines in `AndroidManifest.xml` respect "Redirect URL" for your application at the Developer Dashboard:

~~~xml
<data android:scheme="http" />
<data android:host="example.com/redirect_url" />
~~~

- Build the Android project.
